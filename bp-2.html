    <h2 class="pghead">An IMO Problem with Debatable Rating</h2>
    <h2 class="pghead">Genre: <a class="genre" href="graph-theory.html">Graph Theory</a></h2>
    <p class="formatp">
        <b>Before You Dive In:</b><br/>
        I came across this problem about a week ago or something through <a class="nlink" href="https://dgrozev.wordpress.com/2019/12/05/splitting-the-cliques-of-a-graph-imo-2007-p3/" target="_blank">Grozev's Post</a> where he was speaking about the <i>MOHS hardness scale</i> proposed by Evan Chen. I had taken a screenshot of the problem and today I pondered on it. It's quite obvious that you would likely be tempted to grab some graphs. <br/>
        Evan Chen had given this problem a whopping \(50M\) and I believe it's the highest rating! But Grozev was trying to be generous to give it \(35M\). He also mentioned the fact that rating is mostly subjective and debatable which I completely agree with. Ohh so coming back to my thing, this problem seemed very interesting as I love using graphs. It was also not too late to be cognizant of the fact that this problem really is not that of a beefy guy. You will feel it very intuitive and trivial when you take a look at the problem several times. I suppose, Chen was trolling me(us) or something. Or maybe the fact that "rating is a subjective matter"...<br/><br/>
        


        <b>Problem 3.[IMO 2007]</b> In a mathematical competition some competitors are friends. Friendship is always mutual. Call a group of competitors a clique if each two of them are friends. (In particular, any group of fewer than two competitors is a clique.) The number of members of a clique is called its size. Given that, in this competition, the largest size of a clique is even, prove that the competitors can be arranged in two rooms such that the largest size of a clique contained in one room is the same as the largest size of a clique contained in the other room.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Solution.</b> So as I mentioned the main weapon is graphs. Let me say that \(\mathfrak{G}(V,E)\) be a graph \(\ni |V|=n\) and \(e\in E\) represents friendship. Here \(n\) is the number of competitors.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
        <i>Note:</i> If any \(2\) vertices \(v_i,v_j\in V\) are not adjacent where \(i\ne j\), then there's no friendship between \(v_i\) and \(v_j\).
        </div>
        <p class="formatp">
            At first, all the contestants were having a talk on the fact that "when will Samay post a Stand-Up" in the foyer. After that, they are divided by a wall. Let me just say that the <i>clique</i> with the max size is \(\mathfrak{Q}_{max}\). Aslo just for my convenience let \(|\mathfrak{Q}_{max}|=s_{max}\). And it's mentioned that the largest size of a clique is even. Consider the below graph:
            <img id="img-4" src="img-4.jpg" alt="img-4">
            <figcaption>Fig:1 An example of \(\mathfrak{G}\)</figcaption>
        
        <br/>
        </p>
        <p class="formatp">
            Also let me say that \(R_1,R_2\in \mathfrak{G}\) where \(V_{R_1}\cap V_{R_2}=\phi\). Yes, \(R_1\) corresponds to room one and \(R_2\) for room two. I shall consider the foyer itself as \(R_1\). So in the first step a clique of \(K_6\) with size \(\frac{6}{2}=3\) is put into \(R_2\) and let that clique be \(Q_2\) also the other half which is still in \(R_1\) be \(Q_1\). If \(\exists\) \(Q_i\in R_1 \ni |V_{Q_i}|>3\), and \(|V_{Q_i}|-|V_{Q_1}|=m\), here \(Q_i\) is the next largest clique after \(\mathfrak{Q}_{max}\) contained in \(R_1\). We then take a clique of order \(m\) out of \(Q_1\) and then place it in \(R_2\). If \(|V_{Q_2}|\ge |V_{Q_i}|\), all these shit shall not be considered(what I mean is about the taking out of \(m\) vertices stuff). 
            
            We are pretty much done except for replacing this particular case that I considered with a general case. Also notice that even number-sized cliques don't contribute anything in particular. Let me give you one example:
            <img id="img-5" src="img-5.jpg" alt="img-5">
            <figcaption>Fig:2 Even number sized cliques are not special</figcaption>
            </p>
        <p class="formatp">
            Check and try out some more examples similar to this. If the largest-sized clique in \(\mathfrak{G}\) is not unique then all these shit need not be considered ∎
            <br/><br/>
        
            <b>My Views:</b><br/>
            I still didn't get the fact why the problem is focusing on \(s_{max}\equiv 0(\)mod \(2)\)! Please do let me know why it's so. Grozev, if you ever happen to come across this post then it's my greatest pleasure, Sir. There has been a whole lot of discussions about this problem on AoPS, you can check that out to. I had seen a post on Math-Stackexchange, where a  guy was suggesting to prove this using group-theory. I do not know group theory, but would definitely love to see the idea behind it. Please do let me know about the errors in my proof or typos it any.
